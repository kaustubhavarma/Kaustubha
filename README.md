# About Me
(she/her). Degree in law and business administration. Specialise in technology law and policy.

I am a lawyer based in India working at the intersections of technology and human rights. My workdays consist of legal research, advocacy and litigation, and on the weekends I'm challenging myself on new routes in bouldering gyms. I volunteer my time on projects that set out to make the internet more accessible and secure for the average user. 

I'm also the community manager for Uli, a tool that redacts slurs and abusive content on Twitter, check it out here- https://github.com/tattle-made/OGBV/tree/main/uli-website
